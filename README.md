### Stage 1: Augment SGD data with KETOD (human labelled knowledge augmentation)

KETOD offers the label of each turn about if a enrichment is required. Therefore, for the first stage, we augment KETOD to the SGD data with the labels as well as the enriched responses.

The above implementation can be conducted by running: 
```
    python gen_full_ketod.py
```
